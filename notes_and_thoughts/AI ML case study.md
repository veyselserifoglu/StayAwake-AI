### Data - To be done with, on 07.05.2025
List of [[relevant data sets and resources]]
- First we need to gather data
	- There exist many types of data one focused on detecting eye patterns, face expressions, others focus on the whole body.
	- [ ] We should decide on how are going to approach this shall the model be trained on the whole body or just the face.
		- It would be nice if the model perceives both the whole body behavior as well as the face.
			- [ ] So maybe I can research how can this be possible.
- Second we should build the data.
- Third we do the necessary preprocessing.
### Modelling
- No reinventing the wheel here we will study the state of the art architectures out there and tune them.
	- It would be nice to build it so it can fit edge devices.
	- [Yolov11](https://medium.com/@nikhil-rao-20/yolov11-explained-next-level-object-detection-with-enhanced-speed-and-accuracy-2dbe2d376f71) is the state of the art now.
### Verification
